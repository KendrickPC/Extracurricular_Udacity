##### Extracurricular Notes

## Lesson 1:
[] Ace Your Interview 10 min.
    - Being a problem solver. Star METHOD strategy for problem solving below:

[] STAR METHOD IS THE FOLLOWING: 

Here is one example of a behavioral question and using the STAR method
to respond to it.

How do you handle conflict? How do you solve problems?
Since well functioning teams need to handle conflict, you might
get questions such as:

Describe an example when you had a disagreement with your
coworker/manager. Why did it happen? How did you handle it?

Disagreements by themselves are not a problem. In fact, they are bound to
happen, so it’s all about how you react. Again use the STAR method here,
focusing on how you resolved the situation professionally and
productively, choose a situation in which the disagreement was resolved
well.

Situation: "One day before we were going to launch a new feature, a
new vulnerability was announced in vendor software we use.
Patching the problem adequately meant sliding the already delayed 
schedule. Another team member and I disagreed about which took
precedence, the security patch or the feature release. The marketing 
department had a lot riding on this deadline.”

Task: "We needed to decide which goal to pursue and work together 
as a team."

Action: "We decided to look into the details of each problem together.
Clearly the deadline was important, but our users’ data might be at
risk if we didn’t patch our system. I was tasked to research the
security threat more closely, and I realized it did not apply to
our users because none of them used that browser which had the 
vulnerability. So we could just post a message on our website about
the browser."

Result: "We were able to release our product feature on time even
while taking the time to work together to consider an important issue
not everyone agreed with at the time."

##### Keep the STAR method in mind whenever you are asked to problem-solve
or describe an experience during interviews.

### Analysis of Initiative Interview Question:

Udacity Analysis:
The candidate gave a great example of initiative, and it was related
to documentation (a topic often overlooked by programmers).
The candidate’s tone of voice and pacing could be improved — it felt
a little too mechanical/rehearsed.
The candidate researched his idea before implementing it.
The candidate was specific about the impact of his actions, but
would like to have personalized anecdotes (ex. An employee was
working on a project, and it really helped him…).

### What Motivates You at the Workplace Question:

Udacity Analysis:
The candidate showed high energy, and her passion is evident.
The candidate could have been more specific about what she is
passionate about and how it relates back to the job.

impact of each gesture.
The candidate gave good examples of intrinsic and extrinsic

answered the question fully.
The candidate could minimize the delays in speech (i.e. “uhs” and “ums”)
The candidate spoke more about the team’s effort than his individual
contributions. (Note that depending on the content, there is nothing
wrong with focusing more on the team’s effort. For example, if your
contributions are more managerial in nature, then make sure to focus
on those managerial actions you took to solve the problem.)
The candidate explained the problem and solution in great detail.
He could have emphasized some larger themes in order to make it easier
for the interviewer to synthesize the information and avoid confusion.

solved his problem proactively, and was not afraid to ask for help.
